is expected to provide a block of data of size 'sendcnt' stored in 'sendbuf'.
When the function returns, each process will have the data blocks sent from all
other processes (including itself) stored in 'recvbuf'. recvbuf will be an
array of pointers to the received data (the function is in charge of allocating
the array and the buffer for the received data). recvcnt is an array storing
the size of the data. Again, the function is responsible for allocating the
array. More specifically, the data from the i-th process is received by every
process and placed in the i-th element of the 'recvbuf' and its size is put in
the i-th element of 'recvcnt'. One must not assume that all processes would
provide the same 'sendcnt'. */

If you run the test with, say, 4 MPI processes, the result should look similar
to:
              [0] add_all->6
              [2] collect_all[3]->"hello from rank 3" (sz=18)
