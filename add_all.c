// |     Compile/Run:
// |
// |                  COMPILE
// |                  Once you are in the correct directory where all the
// |                  files are found enter
// |
// |                  make
// |
// |                  - This will compile all the necessary files needed to
// |                    run the program. Incase you just want to compile this
// |                    file then you can run this command to compile
// |
// |                      - mpicc -O -o add_all add_all.c
// |
// |                  - This will create an executable file named
// |                    "add_all"
// |
// |                  RUN
// |                  - Enter this to Run a test version of it
// |
// |                  - mpirun -np 4 --hostfile my-hostfile ./add_all
// |
// |                  - Where 4 is an arbitrary number and you can insert any
// |                    number to create that set of processes run the program.
// |
// |                  - The "--hostfile my-hostfile" was necessary in my case so
// |                  that I could run the programs on my computer. The max
// |                  number of process that my computer would let me run was
// |                  2. This is why I had to create this file and add this
// |                  extension. As it is now you can run up 10 processes.
// |                  However if you intend to run more than 10 processes then
// |                  you will have to go into the file named "my-hostfile" and
// |                  change the number 10 to the number of desired processes.
// |                  This might just be system dependent so it might just be
// |                  that I'm the only one that needs to run it like this.

// |
// |  Description:  [ The main goal of this program is to implement a function
// |                  named add_all() which will act as a collective function.
// |                  It should essentially be a binomial tree where it acts as
// |                  a reduction problem and as the tree is being reduces then
// |                  it adds the numbers together or the leafs of the tree.
// |                  This is an all-to-one reduction. ]
// |
// |        Input:  [ The input is done through the command line. An example
// |                  looks like this:
// |
// |    -  make
// |    -  mpirun -np 4 --hostfile my-hostfile ./add_all
// |                    - Where 4 is the number of processes you want to run the
// |                      program with. Depending on the number you input you
// |                      will get a different value at the end. ]
// |
// |
// |       Output:  [The output of the program depends on the number of process
// |                 you decide to create. If we put 4 then the answers will be
// |                 6. I would go ahead and insert different values to
// |                 see different outputs. However with the file that I have
// |                 named "my-hostfile" it will only let you run it up to 16
// |                 processors. You can configure it to the number of
// |                 processors that you desire to. If we input 16 then the
// |                 output should be 120.]
// |
// |      Process:  [The programâ€™s steps are as follows:
// |                1. You have to do three essential steps so that we can
// |                create an MPI program. You call MPI_Init, MPI_Comm_size,
// |                MPI_Comm_rank.
// |                2. You call the last two MPI methods so that you can get the
// |                essential information so that you know who you need to
// |                communicate to.
// |                3. Then based on the process ID and the step that its
// |                on it will determine who it should receive from and who it
// |                should send to.
// |                4. This was done by determining the required steps needed.
// |                Which is determined by calling the function
// |                returnStepsRequired().
// |                4. When a process receives a value it updates a variable
// |                they hold with the current value or data that they are
// |                carrying to that they can send it to there respective next
// |                neighbor in the binomial tree.
// |                5. Another thing to note is that as they send a number they
// |                are done working so they call MPI_Finalize() becasue they
// |                have finsihed doing there task.
// |                5. Once the root receives the last number then the
// |                all-to-one reduction of the binomial tree has finsished.
// |
// |   Required Features Not Included:  [ Everything was completed ]
// |
// |   Known Bugs:  [ As of now there is a bug when running it with this number
// |                 of processes. And these numbers are from the range of
// |                 0 - 16 becasue thats the number of processes that I have
// |                 in the file named "my-hostfile". (6,10,11,12,14) ]
